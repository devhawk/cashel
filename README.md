Cashel
======

Cashel is a parser combinator library for F#. it is inspired by [Parsec](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Parsec) and [FParsec](http://www.quanttec.com/fparsec/).

Cashel is designed to be simple. As of the [FSharp3 branch](https://github.com/devhawk/cashel/tree/FSharp3) the library has been recompiled with VS 2012 and converted to a portable library so it can be used in Windows Desktop, Windows Store and Windows Phone apps.

Cashel includes [tests](https://github.com/devhawk/cashel/tree/FSharp3/src/Cashel.Tests) as well as a [sample Parsing Expression Grammar parser](https://github.com/devhawk/cashel/tree/FSharp3/src/Cashel.Sample.Peg).
